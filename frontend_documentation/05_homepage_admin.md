1. Display the current logged in user information - this can be done through storing successful login details in the localStorage (Name, email, last logged in date time)
2. Link to 06_add_asset_admin
3. Link to 07_overdue_assets_admin
4. Link to 08_display_reports_admin

Clean UI for this, hardly much to do here
