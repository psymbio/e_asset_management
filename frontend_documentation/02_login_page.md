## Form data
RULES: Everything must have a placeholder
1. username/email
2. password

This means the user can either enter their username or email in the same field area and we have to validate by checking 

Create a JSON with dummy data to validate/add data using javascript
Our dummy database is a JSON file

After successful login we store all user information in the localStorage:
1. id
2. name
3. roleId - (1 for admin, 2 for user) - probably a dropdown
4. telephone 
5. email
6. username
7. password
